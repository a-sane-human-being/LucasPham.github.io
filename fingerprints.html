    <b>Q1. What are the two primary purposes of a secure, HTTPS connection?</b>
    <p> The purposes are to protect people's information, and to authenticate the user who is using the site</P>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Q2. What is an HTTPS Proxy Appliance?</b>
    <p>  It is a device used to circumvent the HTTPS of webpages in order to view the traffic coming from a device.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Q3. What is MITM?  What risks does this present?</b>
    <p>  MITM stands for man-in-the-middle attack. This risk presents the possibility that you're not actually talkin to the person you're supposed to.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b> Q4. What is a hash? What are the essential qualities that make a hash a "good" hash? </b>
    <p>A hash is a condensed version of a certificate's contents. A good hash makes it hard to reconstruct the original password from the output.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Q5. What is a CA? What role do they play?</b>
    <p>   A CA is a certificate authority. The role they play is to help prove the authenticity of the website.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Q6. How can SSL interception be prevented?</b>
    <p>  A SSL interception cannot be prevented, but it can be detected reliably.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Q7. How can SSL interception be detected?</b>
    <p> Because the public and private keys are matched in pairs, the SSL intercepted key must be different. By checking the public key of the server, you can determine if the public key of the certificate and the public key of the server are the same.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Q8. What is a false-positive? What is a false-negative?</b>
    <p>It is possible for false positives to occur when there are large wesites (like Amazon) which use multiple certificates, so when you check the public key, it might show a different kay that might be completely valid.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Q9. Does your school / government / ISP have a right to eavesdrop on your communications?</b>
    <p>Schools should be able to eavesdrop on their own computers because theyre school property, although they shouldn't be able to do this on our personal computers. The government and our ISPs should not be able to see our internet traffic because there is no good reason for them to see our internet information and data.</p>
